# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 1, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the "Basic HTML and HTML5" and "Basic CSS" sections on freeCodeCamp!

**Time Spent**: 1 hour 48 minutes.

**Thoughts**: I've decided to take up the #100DaysOfCode challenge to bring a sense of order to my otherwise chaotic life. I am hoping that the accountability will keep the ball rolling, and in the process I will pick up many invaluable skills that will help me along my journey of self-growth. To kickstart the challenge I will be tackling the amazing [freeCodeCamp curriculum](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/) and where possible I will [stream my progress](https://www.twitch.tv/DeadmanoDoesCode) daily, hopefully allowing for a space where others can drop by and be a part of the journey, offer tips, or even ask for advice. I'm feeling generally excited to learn new and exciting things!

### Day 2: April 2, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed most of the "Applied Visual Design" section in the morning, and completed the rest of it along with "Applied Accessibility" and "Responsive Web Design Principles" sections on freeCodeCamp later on in the evening!

**Time Spent**: 1 hour 1 minute (morning) and 1 hour 28 minutes (evening). 2 hours 29 minutes total.

**Thoughts**: I didn't have much time today as there were several personal matters that I had to attend to, but I managed to squeeze in an hour in the morning to tackle some applied visual design, which was really interesting, especially learning about the animations and just how powerful CSS really is! Later in the evening I managed to find some time to tackle the last bit of applied visual design before moving on to the applied accessibility and responsive web design principles. The accessibility section was quite a bit to take in, but made me realise the importance behind it for those with disabilities. Definitely something I'll be taking into account for future projects! I've also realised that trying to take information in, combined with trying to stream the content in an educational manner, is quite taxing in the evening, so I'll make the effort to do so in the mornings or early afternoons for best results, as I could really feel myself start to flag in the end! I'm really looking forward to tomorrow, since CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid is what will be covered next before the web design projects begin!

### Day 3: April 3, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the "CSS Flexbox" and "CSS Grid" sections and started working on the "Build a Tribute Page" web design project on freeCodeCamp!

**Time Spent**: 1 hour 12 minutes (afternoon) and 2 hours 25 minutes (evening). 3 hours 37 minutes total.

**Thoughts**: Today, I'm going to be honest, I was procrastinating far longer than I should have, as I was really nervous about the upcoming web design projects. A lot of pressure to create something from scratch, with barely any experience at all! I managed to pluck up the courage in the afternoon and finished the "CSS Flexbox" and "CSS Grid" modules over at freeCodeCamp, before deciding to take a quick break to have lunch. When I returned, it was time to tackle my very first web design project from freeCodeCamp; Build a Tribute Page! I thought about it for a moment and then decided to dedicate it to the person who has taught me to never give up on my goals; Chester Bennington. But before I could even begin, I realised just how much of the information from all the modules I did really stuck. I could barely remember the basics, and found myself Googling the rest for reference. The hand-holding approach of being told exactly what to do gives you a sense of achievement, but the moment you're let loose is the moment you realise just how unprepared you really are! All in all, I managed to push through and make good progress, even managing to pass all 10 tests in a single sitting, so all that is left is a bit of polish tomorrow and I'll be done! I'm feeling excited and motivated overall, and the true accomplishment comes from actually creating something from nothing, which I feel the real experience comes from.

### Day 4: April 4, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I added the final touches to the tribute page, which is now complete!

**Time Spent**: 1 hour 43 minutes.

**Thoughts**: I realised that the procrastination I was facing was in part due to the lack of skills I had when it came to what I actually envisioned in my mind for this project. There's so much I wanted to do, so much I wanted to add, but I felt I wasn't really able to comfortably achieve them. So instead of spending hours hacking pieces of code together, I decided to finish off things as best as I could, knowing that the main priority was to pass the 10 tests, which had already been passed yesterday. I improved upon several parts of the design, adding minor things like shadows to the text, borders to section off the biography, and put a bit of effort into having it responsive. All in all, I am happy with the outcome, given my limited experience, and no doubt I'll be able to look back on this in the future and realise how much more I can improve upon on it. It's like life, you learn new things, and you apply them as you go! So that's one project done and dusted, bring on the rest!

### Day 5: April 5, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I completed the "Build a Survey Form" web design project from freeCodeCamp!

**Time Spent**: 3 hours 48 minutes.

**Thoughts**: Today went way better than yesterday! I felt way more confident as I was setting things up, knowing exactly what I wanted to do, and how I was going to do it. I believe the last two days working on my very first project helped me grasp the basics and expand upon it further, as I feel I accomplished way more in less amount of time, finishing up AND polishing the project in a single day! I worked on new ideas I had never done before but I thought might look cool, so a lot of experimenting, as well as trial and error, took place. All in all, I am actually happy with the outcome and I feel I am making progress. I'm somewhat nervous for the next project which will be to build a product landing page, as I feel that will require a bit more design work than simple forms, but we'll see how it goes; if anything it will give me some extra pointers that will most likely come in handy in future projects!

### Day 6: April 6, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I started working on the "Build a Product Landing Page" web design project from freeCodeCamp!

**Time Spent**: 1 hour 7 minutes.

**Thoughts**: Today wasn't as bad as I expected! I jumped into the usual setting up of things such as centering the content on the page, putting it all into one big box to manipulate with CSS, etc. I managed to get 14 of the 16 required tests to complete in the short time I had, and even got to working with a flexbox which usually gives me a headache and a half! The flexbox worked quite well so far, I managed to seperate the header and the nav links, even incorporating Font Awesome into the mix to use for my mock-up companies logo! All in all I am happy with the progress so far, and definitely starting to feel that the more I build, the easier it gets! Tomorrow I plan to flesh out the design a bit more and hopefully resolve the flexbox issues I was having! I've decided that weekends I will try to only do the bare minimum of an hour a day, so as to give myself some time to actually relax and recover before the no doubt hectic week ahead.

### Day 7: April 7, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I continued working on the "Build a Product Landing Page" web design project from freeCodeCamp!

**Time Spent**: 2 hours 57 minutes.

**Thoughts**: Today was pretty exciting! I got all the content filled out, and I began to work on styling the HTML. I feel that I am slowly starting to understand CSS Flexbox, as I managed to pretty much put together the landing page alone using it! I also got some helpful tips from chat that I implemented, such as smooth scrolling for the anchor links and having the nav-bar fixed to the left and right side of the page, using Flexbox's `justify-content: space-between` property! I'm really starting to get into and enjoy this front-end stuff, though still struggling a bit with the creative design side! I realise that I could finish up these projects way sooner, but I put the effort into fleshing them out with actual content instead of placeholder stuff like Lorem Ipsum, as I feel it just gives it a unique touch and makes me feel like I am creating something that could be actually used. What better way to learn than create it, right?!

### Day 8: April 8, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I completed the "Build a Product Landing Page" web design project from freeCodeCamp!

**Time Spent**: 4 hours 39 minutes.

**Thoughts**: Today was absolutely incredible, as I feel I learnt so much! I honestly feel I went all out, pushing my CSS knowledge to the absolute maximum. I managed to make a ton of tweaks to the page thanks to media queries, ensuring the content scales nicely for smaller viewports. I also took the time to add in actual graphics and content that makes sense, fleshing it out into a fully-fledged video game studio that outsources their talents! Looking back on day 1 and day 2 compared to today is honestly like night and day for me, and I still find it hard to believe that I managed to do that. It makes me feel good and motivates me for the last two projects that are coming up. Now I actually have something to fill up the portfolio project with! I'd also like to make a note of how incredible it is to have the community come out and be a part of the process on my livestreams, as I am both able to learn from them, as well as help out where I can when asked questions. That, to me, just seals the deal. My goal is to complete all FCC projects in 10 days, here's to hoping I can manage!

### Day 9: April 9, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I completed the "Build a Technical Documentation Page" web design project from freeCodeCamp!

**Time Spent**: 2 hours 26 minutes (morning) and 5 hours 4 minutes (evening). 7 hours 30 minutes total.

**Thoughts**: I don't think I've worked this hard on a project, as consistently, as I did today! So much effort went into this project, and 3 hours of it went into working on a way to show/hide the elements of the navbar for the technical documentation links, which turned out pretty awesome in the end! I'll flesh this out a bit more if I get a chance tomorrow, I just wanted to be able to post before midnight so it still counts as an update for day 9, as I've literally been busy right until the very end!

### Day 10: April 10, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I completed the "Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage" web design project from freeCodeCamp!

**Time Spent**: 9 hours 53 minutes.

**Thoughts**: I'm actually at a loss for words... I spent almost 10 hours working on this portfolio, trying new things I have never done before, animating a menu, having my intro section of pure text be animated, working on responsive grids, and so much more that has been lost on me as I literally did a livestream for just shy of 10 hours, straight! This due to the fact that I set myself a goal that I'd want to gain the Responsive Web Design certificate by day 10! In the last hour of the day I had only the intro section and part of the projects section ready, and I had to pretty much rush the rest and add filler content so I at least have something presentable. I still plan to flesh it out and add things as I gain more experience, but the most important part here is that I actually passed all the tests! I'll have to update this section and the previous one if I get a chance, as, once again, I'm pressed for time to post to this log before the next day.

### Day 11: April 11, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I polished off the "Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage" web design project and started on the JavaScript section on freeCodeCamp!

**Time Spent**: 4 hours 11 minutes (afternoon) and 2 hours 33 minutes (evening). 6 hours 44 minutes total.

**Thoughts**: I took a bit of time to give the portfolio page a bit of love, adding in animations for the icons, as well as making the website a whole lot more responsive! I still feel the content is lacking, but I am at the very least happy with the overall look and feel, and I'm sure as time progresses I'll be able to add to it! Later on in the evening I finally managed to start on the JavaScript section of freeCodeCamp, and I absolutely LOVED it! From start to finish, I had a blast going through the basics, and I am honestly looking forward to the rest of it, as well as getting to the more advanced and technical stuff. The community was super helpful, and I had a few more new faces pop by and offer their support which really just added to the incredible mood I was in! I feel I am actually getting somewhere, and that feeling alone is priceless and completely empowering. I do, however, feel that the sections are somewhat overwhelming, as the basics section alone is 4x that of the HTML/CSS stuff, and there is still a few more sections including an intermediate one! But I am sure, with time, I will manage, and hopefully the 2 years I spent working on mods for Skyrim will pay off as Papyrus was an object-orientated language.

### Day 12: April 12, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I did many challenges from the "Basic JavaScript" section on freeCodeCamp!

**Time Spent**: 3 hours 14 minutes.

**Thoughts**: So the JavaScript challenges were quite interesting, albeit a bit difficult in certain parts, especially because I would often get tripped up reacquainting myself with JavaScript formatting as I am still used to the previous language I was working on for about 2 years; Papyrus. All in all, I can't wait to get through the sections so I can start working on projects and honing my skills! The object prototypes section is definitely something that fascinates me and I can't wait to pick it back up tomorrow!

### Day 13: April 13, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I struggled through the sections of JavaScript objects from freeCodeCamp!

**Time Spent**: 1 hour 2 minutes.

**Thoughts**: Today was honestly one of the hardest days in this challenge thus far! I was slowly making progress, but once I got to the part where I had to create a function that handles different parameters that had to edit an object's array with nested arrays I felt completely overwhelmed! I had to end up actually ending things mid-way through the challenge as I had to get ready for an event I was attending. On the plus side, I did learn that JSON stands for "JavaScript Object Notation", which I had no idea of prior to this! I'm positive that I'll be able to tackle the challenge tomorrow, but I feel that I also need to allow myself some time to unwind and relax as I've been giving my all into these challenges and projects the past 13 days without any real respite.

### Day 14: April 14, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Even more struggling through JavaScript objects from freeCodeCamp!

**Time Spent**: 3 hours 28 minutes.

**Thoughts**: Just when I thought yesterday was hard... Wow! These JavaScript objects seriously don't mess around! I'm not sure if it is due to the fact of clearing each section without doing revision during the freeCodeCamp modules, or if too much information is being crammed in to my head at once, but I am finding this stuff incredibly difficult! I mean, I do manage, but it takes me significantly longer, and the examples you are given don't quite prepare you for what comes next as often times you need a combination of several previous modules to complete the tasks given. I might have to take things a bit slower and specifically cover JavaScript objects until I feel comfortable, as right now that is the main thing; accessing and adding information to objects and arrays in objects. Other than that, I am still loving it, but the pace is definitely slowing down, at least for this specific section. I feel things will get better once I complete the section and start working on projects, as previously working on projects for the Responsive Web Design section of freeCodeCamp gave me far more exposure and experience than the modules did, as there is a lot of hand-holding by being shown actual examples and then basically copying that example more or less, and once you pass that point you move on to something completely different until later on where you need to now recall all prior modules which you only really covered once.

### Day 15: April 15, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed "Basic JavaScript" and began on the ES6 section from freeCodeCamp!

**Time Spent**: 27 minutes (Basic JavaScript) and 4 hours 7 minutes (ES6). 4 hours 34 minutes total.

**Thoughts**: I decided to take some time to go through JavaScript objects to better understand them, especially on the parts I was struggling on, and it made a world of a difference as I managed to grasp many different things such as the `.write()` part of `Document` being a method of the `Document` object! Besides having gone through the entire "Basic JavaScript" section of freeCodeCamp, I feel that so much progress has been made, especially now that I've started the ES6 section and learnt incredible things along the way, such as being able to have multiple `if/else if/else` statements on a single line using the ternary operator, as well as also having functions on a single line, that support parameters, thanks to arrow functions! This changes everything and truly makes me excited for the language and the possibilities thereof! There were still parts I struggled on, but I feel that is due to certain parts of freeCodeCamp skipping out on information, such as the use of the `map()` method that wasn't really covered in the ES6 module I was working on. A quick search here and there, as well as help from the friendly people in my livestream chat, and all was well again! Looking forward to what new and exciting things ES6 brings to the table!

### Day 16: April 16, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Continued through the ES6 section from freeCodeCamp!

**Time Spent**: 2 hours 55 minutes.

**Thoughts**: And today it was back to struggling as I learnt about destructuring! The initial examples were going well, but later on it got progressively more difficult! Coupled with template literals in the one example and I felt overwhelmed once again! Fun times for sure, and I'll definitely have to go back to cover them both, but I'm genuinely excited to be making progress and referring back to previous things I have learnt to make use of them in the solution. I'm slowly coming to the end of the ES6 section, and the RegEx section has me somewhat fearful! We'll see how things go!

### Day 17: April 17, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Finally completed the ES6 section from freeCodeCamp!

**Time Spent**: 3 hours 37 minutes.

**Thoughts**: I had quite the exciting time figuring out constructors and how classes work in ES6! Definitely makes things way more easier. On top of that, getters and setters were covered, which makes a ton of sense in terms of handling user data, which will come in pretty handy in some projects I have in mind! On top of that, the regulars on my stream kept me going, and I honestly don't know how I'd manage without them, not just for their feedback, but also the banter we have as we go through the sections. The ES6 section was honestly all over the place, covering things such as import, which is an upgrade from include() that we haven't even covered yet! But thankfully the regulars were there to help along the way. Tomorrow is regular expressions, and I have a feeling it isn't going to go that well considering I have pretty much no experience when it comes to using them.

### Day 18: April 18, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I completed the Regular Expressions section from freeCodeCamp!

**Time Spent**: 3 hours 57 minutes.

**Thoughts**: So I was honestly expecting the RegEx stuff to be WAY harder than what it actually ended up being... I found myself being able to manage through 3/4 of the section before the last bit started becoming a bit of a guess-fest as I was trying to figure out what expression did what exactly in combination with several others including quantifiers! All in all, I can see how it would be useful in certain situations and I am glad that I at least have some kind of basic understanding to apply should the need ever arise. Once you understand the basic concepts it just becomes a matter of repetition until it sinks in, and I find the best source of quality repetition is through projects. Who knows, perhaps I'll include some RegEx in a future project?! Tomorrow is debugging! I'll be covering the "Debugging" section of freeCodeCamp and hopefully also manage to get to "Basic Data Structures" as the debugging shouldn't take too long! Progress is being made, and I'm getting closer to those projects; I can't wait!

### Day 19: April 19, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the "Debugging" section and began "Basic Data Structures" from freeCodeCamp!

**Time Spent**: 1 hour 56 minutes.

**Thoughts**: Today I managed to cover the debugging section from freeCodeCamp, though I was a little disappointed as I got it mixed up with catching exceptions/errors etc. so what was covered was stuff I was already familiar with and used frequently. Though it was a great refresher to say the least! Moving on briefly from the debugging section put me in the Basic Data Structures section which covered all the interesting things you can do to arrays. I managed to expand my knowledge on existing topics, as well as learn new methods such as splice() and slice() which are super useful! I feel the most exciting part was using the spread operator to actually copy a reference of an array! Let's see what tomorrow brings!

### Day 20: April 20, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the "Basic Data Structures" section from freeCodeCamp!

**Time Spent**: 2 hours 28 minutes.

**Thoughts**: So I finally got through the Basic Data Structures section of freeCodeCamp, which put a lot of perspective into place for all the gaps that the ES6 section failed to cover! Not only did I cover all the amazing things one can do with arrays, but even more so for objects, which are far easier to work with due to not having specific indexes to work with, but rather `key: value` pairs! Tomorrow I'll be starting with the Basic Algorithm Scripting which should help me put to tests everything that has been covered thus far! Looking back, I'm amazed at how much I've managed to take in, in just 20 days, and at the same time I also can't believe it has only been 20 days! At this rate I'm wondering if I'll be able to complete the entire curriculum in the 100 days? We'll have to see, but I'm aiming for it, as each day seems to get easier and easier the more I learn!

### Day 21: April 21, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Started on the "Basic Algorithm Scripting" section from freeCodeCamp!

**Time Spent**: 3 hours 21 minutes.

**Thoughts**: Today was honestly quite intense, as I had no idea just how "advanced" the "basic" algorithm scripting section would be! It really tested me to the extent of my abilities, and I found myself struggling several times, as most tasks were covering past sections that I hadn't really done much revision on. All in all, there was quite a bit of growth as I solved somewhat complex problems and even managed to refactor them thanks to the wonderful community in my stream chat! Tomorrow is another day, another chance to take in everything I have learnt and hopefully apply it better!

### Day 22: April 22, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Made a ton of progress on the "Basic Algorithm Scripting" section from freeCodeCamp!

**Time Spent**: 1 hour 33 minutes.

**Thoughts**: I managed to do almost all of the challenges in the section, save for 3 as I was pressed for time. When I get back on later I plan to start working on a little web app project that will allow you to basically format your log, such as this one, by simply entering information in fields and generating an output that you can just copy and paste! Should save me quite a bit of time doing these, help me prevent any copy/paste errors, and hopefully help others save time as well!
