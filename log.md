# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 1, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the "Basic HTML and HTML5" and "Basic CSS" sections on freeCodeCamp!

**Time Spent**: 1 hour 48 minutes.

**Thoughts** I've decided to take up the #100DaysOfCode challenge to bring a sense of order to my otherwise chaotic life. I am hoping that the accountability will keep the ball rolling, and in the process I will pick up many invaluable skills that will help me along my journey of self-growth. To kickstart the challenge I will be tackling the amazing [freeCodeCamp curriculum](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/) and where possible I will [stream my progress](https://www.twitch.tv/DeadmanoDoesCode) daily, hopefully allowing for a space where others can drop by and be a part of the journey, offer tips, or even ask for advice. I'm feeling generally excited to learn new and exciting things!
