# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 1, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the "Basic HTML and HTML5" and "Basic CSS" sections on freeCodeCamp!

**Time Spent**: 1 hour 48 minutes.

**Thoughts** I've decided to take up the #100DaysOfCode challenge to bring a sense of order to my otherwise chaotic life. I am hoping that the accountability will keep the ball rolling, and in the process I will pick up many invaluable skills that will help me along my journey of self-growth. To kickstart the challenge I will be tackling the amazing [freeCodeCamp curriculum](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/) and where possible I will [stream my progress](https://www.twitch.tv/DeadmanoDoesCode) daily, hopefully allowing for a space where others can drop by and be a part of the journey, offer tips, or even ask for advice. I'm feeling generally excited to learn new and exciting things!

### Day 2: April 2, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed most of the "Applied Visual Design" section in the morning, and completed the rest of it along with "Applied Accessibility" and "Responsive Web Design Principles" sections on freeCodeCamp later on in the evening!

**Time Spent**: 1 hour 1 minute (morning) and 1 hour 28 minutes (evening). 2 hours 29 minutes total.

**Thoughts** I didn't have much time today as there were several personal matters that I had to attend to, but I managed to squeeze in an hour in the morning to tackle some applied visual design, which was really interesting, especially learning about the animations and just how powerful CSS really is! Later in the evening I managed to find some time to tackle the last bit of applied visual design before moving on to the applied accessibility and responsive web design principles. The accessibility section was quite a bit to take in, but made me realise the importance behind it for those with disabilities. Definitely something I'll be taking into account for future projects! I've also realised that trying to take information in, combined with trying to stream the content in an educational manner, is quite taxing in the evening, so I'll make the effort to do so in the mornings or early afternoons for best results, as I could really feel myself start to flag in the end! I'm really looking forward to tomorrow, since CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid is what will be covered next before the web design projects begin!

### Day 3: April 3, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the "CSS Flexbox" and "CSS Grid" sections and started working on the "Build a Tribute Page" web design project on freeCodeCamp!

**Time Spent**: 1 hour 12 minutes (afternoon) and 2 hours 25 minutes (evening). 3 hours 37 minutes total.

**Thoughts** Today, I'm going to be honest, I was procrastinating far longer than I should have, as I was really nervous about the upcoming web design projects. A lot of pressure to create something from scratch, with barely any experience at all! I managed to pluck up the courage in the afternoon and finished the "CSS Flexbox" and "CSS Grid" modules over at freeCodeCamp, before deciding to take a quick break to have lunch. When I returned, it was time to tackle my very first web design project from freeCodeCamp; Build a Tribute Page! I thought about it for a moment and then decided to dedicate it to the person who has taught me to never give up on my goals; Chester Bennington. But before I could even begin, I realised just how much of the information from all the modules I did really stuck. I could barely remember the basics, and found myself Googling the rest for reference. The hand-holding approach of being told exactly what to do gives you a sense of achievement, but the moment you're let loose is the moment you realise just how unprepared you really are! All in all, I managed to push through and make good progress, even managing to pass all 10 tests in a single sitting, so all that is left is a bit of polish tomorrow and I'll be done! I'm feeling excited and motivated overall, and the true accomplishment comes from actually creating something from nothing, which I feel the real experience comes from.
